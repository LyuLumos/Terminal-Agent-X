# Terminal-Agent-X

[EN](README.md) / [中文](README_cn.md)

## Install

TBD.

## Config

You need to add the environment variable `OpenAI_KEY` to the path.

```bash
# On Linux
vim ~/.bashrc
# add this line to the end of the file
export OpenAI_KEY=sk-xxx
# save and execute
source ~/.bashrc

# For Windows, you can google how to set environment variables on Windows.
```

Use `python -c "import os;print(os.environ.get('OpenAI_KEY'))"` for testing.

You can get your `OpenAI_KEY` from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).


## Get Started

You can use the `tax <prompt>` to interact with the model, like this:

```
tax write a python code for fibonacci
```

Use `tax -h` to get more information.

## Support

I have tested on Windows 10/11(cmd) and Ubuntu 22.04, it should work on other platforms.

Current version does not support Windows Powershell, or run on Windows systems early than Windows 10. For these users, you can install `curl on Windows` to use this tool.

## Attention

You can see a directive after the generated command that says
```
Do you want to execute the command? (y/n)
```
Please execute it or not at your own discretion. I am not responsible for the consequences of generated commands.
